    "#### Project Phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "Outcome: create an indicator that you can combine with technical indicators increase accuracy for trading by gauging the current sentimenet of people \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 1: Data Collection**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "retrive data from PRAW\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Questions: \n",
    "how to use praw and what are the data formarts i get ? \n",
    "how to create batches to respect rate limits?  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set up Reddit API using PRAW.\n",
    "3. Write scripts to scrape historical data from Reddit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement for Phase 2: Preprocessing and Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Develop a system to preprocess and cluster subreddit data to analyze sentiment and trends related to specific coins. Address the challenge of valuation in sentiment analysis by determining the appropriate value to assign to data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieve Subreddit Data:**\n",
    "   - Use the `.hot()`, `.new()`, `.controversial()`, `.rising()`, and `.top()` methods to get posts from various subreddits.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Combine Data:**\n",
    "   - Combine the retrieved posts into a single dataframe for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Filter Posts:**\n",
    "   - Filter the posts using specific keywords and phrases related to particular coins.\n",
    "   - Remove duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Retrieve Comments:**\n",
    "   - Extract all comments from the relevant posts and add them to the dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Filter Comments:**\n",
    "   - Filter the comments again using the same keywords and phrases to ensure relevance to the particular coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Sort Comments:**\n",
    "   - Sort the filtered comments by time to analyze trends over a specific period.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Sentiment Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Use CryptoBERT to assign numerical sentiment values to the submissions, enabling quantitative analysis of sentiment trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What keywords and phrases should be used to filter posts and comments for specific coins?\n",
    "\n",
    "how to factor in score ? \n",
    "- maybe filter submission for having predictive value or not if so give the score a metric if not leave out the score \n",
    "\n",
    "What value should be given to recent data in sentiment analysis?\n",
    "Should the valuation approach resemble an Exponential Moving Average (EMA), where more weight is placed on the most recent sentiment?\n",
    "Should past data be given no value at all?\n",
    "What is an appropriate timeframe for a daily sentiment metric?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 4: Testing and Documentation**\n",
    "1. Conduct thorough testing of the entire system to ensure accuracy and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Document the code and project, including a detailed README file with instructions.\n",
    "3. Create visualizations of the results (e.g., sentiment trends, word clouds) using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.\n",
    "4. Finalize documentation and visualizations.\n",
    "5. Prepare a presentation or report for future employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Outcome:\n",
    "A functional model that accurately classifies sentiments from tweets and Reddit comments, providing insights into social media trends regarding cryptocurrency trading. A well-documented project showcasing your skills to future employers.\n"

    "### Potential Pitfalls and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection:**\n",
    "   - **Pitfall:** API rate limits and data access restrictions.\n",
    "     - **Solution:** Use libraries like Tweepy for Twitter and PRAW for Reddit, which handle rate limits and provide robust API access.\n",
    "   - **Pitfall:** Inconsistent data formats and missing data.\n",
    "     - **Solution:** Implement data validation and cleaning scripts to handle inconsistencies and missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Preprocessing:**\n",
    "   - **Pitfall:** Handling large volumes of text data efficiently.\n",
    "     - **Solution:** Use SpaCy for efficient text preprocessing and leverage its built-in functions for tokenization, stop words removal, etc.\n",
    "   - **Pitfall:** Ensuring text data is properly cleaned and standardized.\n",
    "     - **Solution:** Use pre-written scripts for common preprocessing tasks like lowercasing, removing special characters, and stemming/lemmatization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Development:**\n",
    "   - **Pitfall:** Training models from scratch can be time-consuming and computationally expensive.\n",
    "     - **Solution:** Use pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Transformers library (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) and fine-tune them on your dataset.\n",
    "   - **Pitfall:** Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization.\n",
    "     - **Solution:** Use libraries like Scikit-learn for hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV) and model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Integration:**\n",
    "   - **Pitfall:** Integrating the sentiment analysis model with the data pipeline.\n",
    "     - **Solution:** Write modular code and use functions to encapsulate different parts of the pipeline, making integration easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Visualization:**\n",
    "   - **Pitfall:** Creating meaningful and clear visualizations.\n",
